<h3>AI Article Summarizer using GPT-4 API</h3>

Built Using:
- React
- Tailwind
- Redux (For state management)
- Axios for API retrieval
- “Article Extractor and Summarizer” API from RapidAPi
- React-Icons
- etc..

This is an exciting new project, I made an app that utilizes AI; 
Seela, the summarizer is able to take a weblink and summarize the content,
could be an article, or a webpage. 

For the front-end, I focused on making an elegant and clean looking app, 
using tools like tailwind definitely helped in making the app responsive 
and make it stable and smooth. The app is only 1 page, so not much work came 
from making the front-end.
